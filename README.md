# SQL Queries (DDL & DML)
This repository contains basic SQL queries created as part of my database course. The SQL scripts are organized into two main categories:
## 🏗️ DDL (Data Definition Language)
Scripts for creating and defining the database structure, including tables and constraints.
## 📝 DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Scripts for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from the database.
## ⚠️ Important
Please execute the **DDL.sql** file first to set up the necessary database schema before running any DML queries.
## 📁 Files Included
- **DDL.sql** – Contains table creation scripts along with primary key constraints and other schema definitions.
- **DML.sql** – Includes `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` statements based on the created schema.
## 🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my database course and demonstrates my understanding of basic SQL operations, including schema creation and data handling.
